# Introduction

The Disease Prediction project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze user-provided health data and predict the probability of specific diseases. This can be particularly useful in areas with limited access to healthcare, offering an early indication of potential health issues.

# Features

**User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for inputting health data.

**Multiple Disease Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of various diseases.

**Detailed Reports**: Provides comprehensive reports of prediction results.

**Scalable**: Designed to be easily scalable and deployable.

# Technologies Used

**Javascirpt**: Core programming language.

**Scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning.

**Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.

**NumPy**: Numerical computations.

**HTML/CSS**: Frontend development for the user interface.

# Installation

**Follow these steps to set up the project locally:**

* **Clone the repository:**

sh

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/Ayu-hack/Disease-Prediction.git

cd Disease-Prediction

* **Create a virtual environment:**

sh

Copy code

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

* **Install dependencies:**

sh

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt

* **Set up the Flask application:**

sh

Copy code

export FLASK_APP=app.py  # On Windows use `set FLASK_APP=app.py`

* **Run the application:**

sh

Copy code

flask run

# Usage

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Fill in the required health data in the provided form.

Submit the form to receive prediction results.

Review the detailed report generated by the application.

# Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is not included in this repository due to size and privacy constraints. You can use publicly available medical datasets or your own data to train the model. Ensure the data is properly preprocessed and cleaned before training.
